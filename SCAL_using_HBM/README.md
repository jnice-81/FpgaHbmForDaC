Contains different implementations to compute the BLAS operator scal on FPGA using HBM. The target platform is xilinx xdma u280; to change it have a look at the makefile and the include/helpers.hpp file. Different Implementations follow a naming structure like (what; memory; memory processed by one burst access of a logical compute device; inner unroll factor for compute loop; number of kernels, additional stuff). For example scal_hbm_1k_16p_1kernel indicates that it's an implementation of scal using hbm reading/writing 1 KB during one burst read cycle, with an inner unrolled loop computing 16 element, and with 16 kernels.
