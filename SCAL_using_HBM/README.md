Contains different implementations to compute the BLAS operator scal on FPGA using HBM. The target platform is xilinx xdma u280; to change it have a look at the makefile and the include/helpers.hpp file. Different Implementations follow a naming structure like (what; memory; memory processed by one burst access of a logical compute device; inner unroll factor for compute loop; number of kernels, additional stuff). For example scal_hbm_1k_16p_1kernel indicates that it's an implementation of scal using hbm reading/writing 1 KB during one burst read cycle, with an inner unrolled loop computing 16 element, and with 16 kernels. 

In order to build a kernel run "make {kernel target name} TARGET={sw_emu/hw_emu/hardware}". To build the host application, which can run all kernels run "make host". To actually execute the kernel you have to execute "./host {implementation} {xclbin file} {verbose/test}" (you will likely want verbose, test is just for writing to files). To see a list of possible values for {implementation} run host without any arguments. To change the input data size modify DATA_SIZE in [include](https://github.com/jnice-81/FpgaHbmForDaCe/blob/master/SCAL_using_HBM/include/include.hpp) and recompile. Carefull: All kernels expect the input size to be dividable by some value.
